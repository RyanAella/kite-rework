# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- **Settings Footer**: Unified the version display in Settings with the one on
  the Legal Information screen (now `text-[3cqw]`, `font-medium` and
  `text-[#0b1a2d]/70` instead of the smaller `text-[2cqw]`)

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Automatic image registration**: The import script now regenerates
  `app/assets/json/image-paths.json` on every run by scanning
  `app/assets/Images/` recursively; new flag `--generate-image-paths`
  regenerates the file without importing a novel

### Changed
- **Documentation**: `image-paths.json` removed from all manual import steps
  (README, import guide, student guide, architecture)

### Fixed
- **Interactive Objects**: Repointed the remaining `InvestorÜberzeugen` frame
  paths in `interactive-objects-info.json` to the `Investor` folder they were
  moved to in 1.1.0

### Removed
- **Legacy assets**: Deleted seven leftover pre-1.1.0 `EventAnimations` folders
  (`BüroAnmieten`, `ElternInformieren`, `InterviewAbklären`,
  `InvestorÜberzeugen`, `MitNotarinTelefonieren`, `HonorarVerhandeln`,
  `KreditBeantragen`) whose contents already exist in the renamed folders

---

## [1.2.5] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- **Novel Importer**: Novel-end events are now derived from the `>>End<<` macro
  in the twee source instead of rewriting the last choices event in the array,
  which could mark the wrong passage as the novel's end

---

## [1.2.4] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- **Settings Footer**: Removed a duplicated `text-[3cqw]` class that was overridden by `text-[2cqw]` in the version footer

### Removed
- **Novel Importer**: Removed the unused `BIAS_MAP` constant (dead code since the
  bias list moved to `biases.txt`)

---

## [1.2.3] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- **Version Display**: Settings and Legal Information now show the actual app version from a central `APP_VERSION` constant that is kept in sync with CHANGELOG.md; previously both screens showed leftover version numbers from the Unity development (1.5.1 / 1.6.2) that never existed in this app's changelog

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- **Knowledge Search**: Closing a knowledge card that was opened from search results now restores the full knowledge view — the search bar reappears and the search state resets; previously the search bar stayed hidden and the category view was not rebuilt

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- **Archive Sorting**: Archive entries are now sorted newest-first (by play
  date), matching the Unity original; previously the order depended on when
  a novel was first started, not last played

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **AI Feedback via Kite2 Server**: The completion scene now requests AI feedback
  from the shared Kite2 backend (kite2.site), using the same protocol as the
  Unity original: HMAC-signed session auth with a temporary bearer token
- **Prompt Service**: New `prompt-service.js` assembles the feedback prompt from
  the shared template (`prompt.txt`), the novel context and the bias list
- **Novel Context**: Novels now carry a `context` field (sourced from
  `contextForPrompt` in the novel metadata) that frames the AI analysis;
  the importer emits it automatically for future imports
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages workflow injects the HMAC passphrase into
  `index.html` from the `KITE_HMAC_SECRET` repository secret

### Changed
- **Dialogue Transcript**: The transcript now includes character names and
  inline bias hints from the novel events, giving the AI the full context
  the prompt template announces

### Removed
- **Local Gemini Server**: Removed the unused `server/` directory (localhost
  feedback proxy); all feedback requests go to the Kite2 server

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- **Mapping Files**: Added `app/assets/mappings/` with `event-types.json` and
  `face-expressions.txt` as single source of truth, shared between the JS app
  and the Python novel importer
- **Mapping Service**: Added `mapping-service.js` which loads and caches the
  mapping files at app start

### Changed
- **Magic Numbers Removed**: Replaced hardcoded event type and expression IDs
  with named constants in `event-resolver-component.js`, `novel-scene.js`,
  `date-heading-component.js` and `path-finding-service.js`
- **Character Path Resolution**: `path-finding-service.js` now resolves image
  folders via `folderName` from `character-info.json` instead of a hardcoded
  if/else chain — adding a new character no longer requires code changes
- **Novel Importer**: `import_novel.py` reads the shared `face-expressions.txt`
  instead of maintaining a duplicate expression map

### Removed
- **Debug Logging**: Removed leftover `console.log`/`console.debug` statements
- **Tests**: Removed non-functional `app/tests/` directory

---
